Task -1:
🎯 Objective:

Use Go variables to track and manage multiple application versions, simulate deployment changes, and record release information like environment, author, and build number.

🧱 Scenario

You’re a DevOps Engineer at Sonata Software, and you’re responsible for maintaining build version info for applications being deployed to different environments (Dev, QA, and Prod).

You’ll use Go variables to:

Store release metadata

Update version numbers

Simulate deployments

Print a clean deployment summary

⚙️ Requirements

Use constants for company name and supported environments.

Use variables for:

App name

Version number (float)

Build number (int)

Deployment author

Environment (string)

Status (bool)

Simulate:

A deployment in one environment

An updated version and build

A rollback scenario

Task - 2:
🎯 Objective:

Use functions in Go to analyze log entries, detect errors, count total issues, and print a clean summary report.
You’ll apply:

Functions with parameters

Return values

String operations

Loops and decision-making

🧱 Scenario

You’re working as a DevOps engineer at Sonata Software.
After every deployment, a log file is generated with entries like:

INFO: Deployment started
INFO: Connecting to database
ERROR: Connection timeout
INFO: Retrying...
SUCCESS: Deployment completed


You must write a Go program that:

Analyzes each log entry

Detects lines containing "ERROR" or "SUCCESS"

Counts errors and successful operations

Displays a final status summary
